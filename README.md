# Basic CRUD Setup for GraphQL

This is a basic GraphQL schema with CRUD functionality.

It updates the `db.json` file according to the schemas run in Graphiql.

This was a good way to get a basic introduction to the concepts of using GraphQL.

### Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:puyanwei/graphql-CRUD-udemy.git
cd graphql-CRUD-udemy
npm install
```

run both the `json-server` and our own server with;

```
npm start
npm run json:server
```

Run the schemas in Graphiql by going to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
